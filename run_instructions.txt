My local operating system (Windows) plays a crucial role in running your Java + MySQL project — here's how everything works together:

1. I write Java code
My .java files (like Main.java, StudentDAO.java) contain code written in Java syntax.

I use: javac *.java; to compile them into .class files — machine-readable bytecode.

2. Java Virtual Machine (JVM) takes over
After compilation, 
when I run: java -cp ".;../lib/mysql-connector-j-9.1.0.jar" Main

I am telling the JVM: “Run the bytecode starting from Main.class” and use the MySQL Connector JAR too

The JVM is a virtual runtime environment installed on my OS that:
a.Interprets bytecode
b.Allocates memory
c.Manages program execution

My Windows OS launches the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) which includes the JVM.

3. JVM connects to MySQL via JDBC
My code uses: DriverManager.getConnection(...) to talk to the MySQL database server.

The JDBC driver (mysql-connector-j-9.1.0.jar) acts as a bridge:
a.Converts Java method calls into MySQL protocol
b.Sends them over TCP/IP to localhost:3306 (MySQL server)

My OS handles:
a.Opening a socket
b.Connecting to MySQL installed on your machine

4. MySQL stores data on your hard drive
My MySQL database engine:
a.Executes SQL commands (INSERT, SELECT, etc.)
b.Reads/writes .ibd and .frm files stored on disk
c.Returns results back to your Java program

All this happens locally — 

My OS manages:
a.Disk I/O
b.Network sockets
c.Process scheduling

In Summary-
Layer-	        Role-
Java Code	    Your logic (CRUD, input, DB calls)
JVM	            Runs compiled .class files
JDBC Driver	    Connects Java to MySQL
MySQL Server	Stores student data
Windows OS	    Runs everything, manages files, sockets, memory

Why it works "locally":
Because: Java + MySQL are installed on your machine and my OS (Windows) manages system resources and allows inter-process communication between Java and MySQL
